    <h3 class="text-center">Objectives</h5>
    <br>   
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be "classically trained". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a Bachelor of Music or Master of Music degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, "...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level" is required.<br>
    Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in sight-reading and ensemble playing, harmonic principles, strong ear training (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of performance practice (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some "popular" genre musicians have had significant classical training, such as Billy Joel, Elton John, the Van Halen brothers, Randy Rhoads, Ritchie Blackmore, and Dream Theater members.[citation needed] Moreover, formal training is not unique to the classical genre. Many rock and pop musicians have completed degrees in commercial music programs such as those offered by the Berklee College of Music and many jazz musicians have completed degrees in music from universities with jazz programs, such as the Manhattan School of Music and McGill University.    
    <br>
     <h3 class="text-center">Values</h5>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every modern piece of music whether it be rhythm and blues, jazz, to pop, behind the lyrics and melodies can all can be traced back to the classics. Every piece of music for centuries now has been interpreted and integrated with classical overtones. Even today's rap and rock and roll all have classical overtures that are blended in. Without the great composers like Bach, Hayden, or Mozart most of today's music probably wouldn't exist.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of classical music cannot be stressed enough. From an artist's point of view, classical music is the epitome of what musicians strive for in their own form of their music interpretation. From an audience's point of view, classical music stirs the imagination, creativity, emotions, and feelings that otherwise wouldn't occur at the same intensity while listening to other forms of music.</p>
